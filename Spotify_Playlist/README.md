Clone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/yourusername/billboard-spotify-automator.git](https://github.com/yourusername/billboard-spotify-automator.git)
cd billboard-spotify-automator

SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=[http://example.com](http://example.com)
🏃‍♂️ UsageRun the main script:python main.py
What happens next?The script will scrape the song titles from Billboard.It will open a browser window asking you to authorize the Spotify app (only the first time).Once authorized, it creates a playlist titled "Billboard 100" in your Spotify account and adds the songs!⚠️ NotesMatching Accuracy: The script searches Spotify using the song title. Occasionally, if a song title is very generic or formatted differently on Billboard, Spotify might return a different version or fail to find it. The script prints a message to the console if a song is skipped.Web Scraping: Billboard's website structure changes occasionally. If the scraper stops finding songs, the HTML class selectors in main.py may need updating.👨‍💻 AuthorMohammed Sameed HussainEngineering Physics Graduate, IIT HyderabadIncoming Master's Student in Physics at LMU MunichFeel free to reach out for collaboration or questions!
